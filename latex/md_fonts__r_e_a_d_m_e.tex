This directory contains the fonts used internally by Muse\+Score and the sources used to generate them.

{\bfseries Font\+Forge} is used to work on the fonts and the sources are all in the $\ast$$\ast$.sfd$\ast$$\ast$ format used by Font\+Forge.

\subsection*{Sub-\/directories}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries bravura} The \href{http://www.smufl.org/fonts/}{\tt {\itshape Bravura}} fonts and the documentation for them and for S\+Mu\+FL. These fonts are {\bfseries not} maintained by the Muse\+Score community, please {\bfseries DO N\+OT E\+D\+IT} these fonts.
\item {\bfseries gootville} The \href{http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/gonville/}{\tt {\itshape Gonville} font} for score musical symbols. This font is modified and maintained by the Muse\+Score project.
\item {\bfseries mscore} The main font used in Muse\+Score scores for musical symbols (formerly known as \href{http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/the-feta-font}{\tt {\itshape Emmentaler}}), as well its counterpart used for texts.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other files in the main {\bfseries fonts} directories are for collateral fonts used by Muse\+Score for specific tasks. If an $\ast$.sfd$\ast$ file is present, the font is maintained/customized by the Muse\+Score community.

\subsection*{Notes on using Font\+Forge}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Version}\+: Font\+Forge version of 2014-\/05-\/27 is known to have generated .ttf fonts not working under Windows. Until the actual reason of the failure is understood, {\bfseries please do not use it}. Version of 2012-\/07-\/31 is known to work.
\item {\bfseries Font names}\+: In some Fontforge versions and/or under some platforms, Fontforge seems to skip the \char`\"{}\+Full\+Name\char`\"{} line while saving the font and this makes a .ttf generated from the source unusable under Windows. To ensure that this line is always output, select \char`\"{}\+Element $\vert$ Font info...\char`\"{}, tab \char`\"{}\+P\+S Names\char`\"{} and make sure the string \char`\"{}\+Name for humans\+:\char`\"{} is different from the string \char`\"{}\+Fontname\+:\char`\"{}.
\item {\bfseries Kern}\+: To ensure fonts are properly kerned under all supported platforms, {\bfseries uncheck} the \char`\"{}\+Old style \textquotesingle{}kern\textquotesingle{}\char`\"{} checkbox in the \char`\"{}\+Option\char`\"{} subdialog of the \char`\"{}\+Generate Font\char`\"{} dialog box.
\item {\bfseries Open\+Type}\+: For Muse\+Jazz at least but perhaps other fonts, it had at one time been determined that Mac\+OS requires you to check the \char`\"{}\+Open\+Type\char`\"{} box in order for kerning to work, although Linux and Windows required it to be {\bfseries unchecked}. It seems this has changed since then (probably on account of a change within Qt) and now it seems proper to always check \char`\"{}\+Open\+Type\char`\"{}. But please try to verify that fonts you generate from $\ast$.sfd$\ast$ sources kern properly on all platforms, and be aware that playing with the \char`\"{}\+Apple\char`\"{} / \char`\"{}\+Open\+Type\char`\"{} / \char`\"{}\+Old style kern\char`\"{} options may be necessary, regardless of what we believe {\bfseries should} work in theory.
