k\+Q\+O\+Auth is a library written in C++ for Qt that implements the O\+Auth 1.\+0 authentication specification R\+FC 5849 (\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849}{\tt http\+://tools.\+ietf.\+org/html/rfc5849}). Greetings go to Dominik Kapusta for writing the original O\+Auth library using Qt, Q\+O\+Auth (\href{http://blog.ayoy.net/2009/6/24/oauth}{\tt http\+://blog.\+ayoy.\+net/2009/6/24/oauth}). However, I wanted to improve on the Q\+O\+Authâ€™s approach in some ways. k\+Q\+O\+Auth main features\+: Easy integrated solution for retrieving user authentication and access token. No external dependency to Q\+CA. Convenient signals that can be used for easy O\+Auth authorization process handling. Access to request objects that will wrap request signing and network access, but still gives possibility for detailed control of the authentication process for easier integration to existing application logic.
