\subsection{Detailed Description}
Detect overlap in a voice, which is when a voice has two or more notes active at the same time. In theory this should not happen, as voices only move forward in time, but Sibelius 7 reuses voice numbers in multi-\/ staff parts, which leads to overlap.

Current implementation does not detect voice overlap within a staff, but only between staves.
