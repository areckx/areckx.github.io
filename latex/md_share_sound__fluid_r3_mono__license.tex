I hereby release Fluid under the M\+IT license, as described in C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+NG.

Thanks to Toby Smithe for helping to get Fluid included in Ubuntu.

This package, of course, is the original Release 3 of Fluid.

Fluid was constructed in part from samples found in the public domain that I edited/cleaned/remixed/programmed and largely from recordings of my own and in conjunction with the people below who helped along the way\+:

Suren M. Seron Scott Hanan Steve Aupperle Chris Gillman Alex Taubr Chris Prola Andrew Klenk Winfried Hubbe Dylan Tim Gort Uros Katic Ethan Winer (\href{http://www.ethanwiner.com}{\tt http\+://www.\+ethanwiner.\+com})

It\textquotesingle{}s obviously been a few years since the project, but its nice to see that people are still enjoying my work and getting good use out of it. As always, I\textquotesingle{}d like to hear some work done with Fluid so email me, or just email me to say hello and tell me what is going on in the computer musician world. Who knows, maybe I\textquotesingle{}ll kick start this project again? ;)
