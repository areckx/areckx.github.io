The shell script \char`\"{}gen\char`\"{} creates a subdirectory {\ttfamily html} with the H\+T\+ML file {\ttfamily vtest.\+html} for visual compare including all needed image files. Travis generates this too and then uploads to \href{http://vtest.musescore.org/index.html}{\tt http\+://vtest.\+musescore.\+org/index.\+html}

\subsection*{Requirements }

In order to generate the diff between the reference file and the generated one, {\itshape Image Magick} needs to be installed and \char`\"{}compare\char`\"{} should be in the {\ttfamily P\+A\+TH}.

\subsection*{Add a new test }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item clone a mscz test file into {\ttfamily xxx.\+mscz}
\item create the test by editing the {\ttfamily xxx.\+mscz} file
\item create reference P\+NG {\ttfamily xxx-\/ref.\+png}\+: mscore xxx.\+mscz -\/o -\/r 130 xxx-\/ref.\+png
\item add the file to {\ttfamily gen} and {\ttfamily gen.\+bat} 
\end{DoxyItemize}
