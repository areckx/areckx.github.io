<listitem><para><bold>Version</bold>: FontForge version of 2014-05-27 is known to have generated .ttf fonts not working under Windows. Until the actual reason of the failure is understood, <bold>please do not use it</bold>. Version of 2012-07-31 is known to work.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>Font names</bold>: In some Fontforge versions and/or under some platforms, Fontforge seems to skip the &quot;FullName&quot; line while saving the font and this makes a .ttf generated from the source unusable under Windows. To ensure that this line is always output, select &quot;Element | Font info...&quot;, tab &quot;PS Names&quot; and make sure the string &quot;Name for humans:&quot; is different from the string &quot;Fontname:&quot;.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>Kern</bold>: To ensure fonts are properly kerned under all supported platforms, <bold>uncheck</bold> the &quot;Old style &apos;kern&apos;&quot; checkbox in the &quot;Option&quot; subdialog of the &quot;Generate Font&quot; dialog box.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>OpenType</bold>: For MuseJazz at least but perhaps other fonts, it had at one time been determined that MacOS requires you to check the &quot;OpenType&quot; box in order for kerning to work, although Linux and Windows required it to be <bold>unchecked</bold>. It seems this has changed since then (probably on account of a change within Qt) and now it seems proper to always check &quot;OpenType&quot;. But please try to verify that fonts you generate from *.sfd* sources kern properly on all platforms, and be aware that playing with the &quot;Apple&quot; / &quot;OpenType&quot; / &quot;Old style kern&quot; options may be necessary, regardless of what we believe <bold>should</bold> work in theory. </para></listitem></orderedlist>
