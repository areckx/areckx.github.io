\fBVersion\fP: FontForge version of 2014-05-27 is known to have generated \&.ttf fonts not working under Windows\&. Until the actual reason of the failure is understood, \fBplease do not use it\fP\&. Version of 2012-07-31 is known to work\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBFont names\fP: In some Fontforge versions and/or under some platforms, Fontforge seems to skip the 'FullName' line while saving the font and this makes a \&.ttf generated from the source unusable under Windows\&. To ensure that this line is always output, select 'Element | Font info\&.\&.\&.', tab 'PS Names' and make sure the string 'Name for humans:' is different from the string 'Fontname:'\&.
.IP "3." 4
\fBKern\fP: To ensure fonts are properly kerned under all supported platforms, \fBuncheck\fP the 'Old style 'kern'' checkbox in the 'Option' subdialog of the 'Generate Font' dialog box\&.
.IP "4." 4
\fBOpenType\fP: For MuseJazz at least but perhaps other fonts, it had at one time been determined that MacOS requires you to check the 'OpenType' box in order for kerning to work, although Linux and Windows required it to be \fBunchecked\fP\&. It seems this has changed since then (probably on account of a change within Qt) and now it seems proper to always check 'OpenType'\&. But please try to verify that fonts you generate from *\&.sfd* sources kern properly on all platforms, and be aware that playing with the 'Apple' / 'OpenType' / 'Old style kern' options may be necessary, regardless of what we believe \fBshould\fP work in theory\&.
